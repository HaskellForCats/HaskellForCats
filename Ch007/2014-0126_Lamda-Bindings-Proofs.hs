Haskell Curry (1900 - 1982) where we get language name and a primary feature of it. 

Moses Schonfinkel (1889-1942) 
His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators B, C, I, K, and S. SchÃ¶nfinkel was able to show that the system could be reduced to just K and S and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same His paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument. This replacement mechanism simplifies work in both combinatory logic and lambda calculus and would later be called currying, after Haskell Curry power as predicate logic

same is true of functions 
f x = g x (x+1) 
g x y = x + y * y 

g's x has nothing to do with f's x 
  that's why we can have (x:xs) all over and they don't clash  a variable in a function definition has a scope that is contained in the right hand side, g's x use case 
is only in the = (x + y * y) unless we call (g x) y 
 elsewhere.

--                   -- PROOFS --   
--------------------------------------------------------
proofs are stronger than tests, 
because no matter how many tests we preform, 
there will be edge cases that must be accounted for.

Proofs take testing to the next level, 
and functional programming can take advantage of that; 
for once something is proved for a function, 
it has passed and will always pass all tests.
 
Computers are literal minded; 
they only understand only what they are given. 
Constructing a proof on a computer seems like a natural; 
where as logicians can be tripped up with their own clever semitics,
computers can't.
 
Symbolic Manipulation is something computers can do well, 
especially where there aren't ambiguities. 


4195835 / 3145727 == 1.333820449136241002

The Pentium FDIV bug was a bug in the Intel P5 Pentium floating point unit (FPU). 
Because of the bug, the processor would return incorrect results. 
Intel blamed the problem on a few missing entries in the lookup table used by the company. 
The cost of the recall, 1/2 billion dollars in write offs. 
How much of an error?

Leibniz:

Equality is reflexive: x = x 
Equals may be substituted for equals. 

yet in java you can happily write: 
i++ != i++ 
which will always return true! 


In Haskell equals may be substituted for equals just about everywhere. 
This is one reason why functions are easier to reason about than objects.

associativity If a binary operation is associative, repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless how valid pairs of parenthesis are inserted in the expression 

identity In algebra, an identity or identity element of a set S with a binary operation is an element e that, when combined with any element x of S, produces that same x. 

commutativity In mathematics, a binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result.
distributivity 

zero 

idempotence  is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
