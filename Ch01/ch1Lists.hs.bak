{------ notes -------------------------------
    [x*x | x <- [1,2,3] ] is a list comprehension 
   x <- [1,2,3] is a generator 
   <- means "drawn from" 
   [(1,False).....] pairs in a list 
   | are guards and they evaluate true or false 
   isLower 
   Converts a letter to the corresponding lower-case letter, if any. Any other character is returned unchanged.

{------ notes -------------------------------
    isAlpha Selects alphabetic Unicode characters (lower-case, upper-case and title-case letters, plus letters of caseless scripts and modifiers letters).

{------ notes -------------------------------
When you encounter a function you can politely ask
Are you Associative?
What is you identity element? 
For + and - it will be 0 
For * and / it will be 1
for [] it my be 1 or 0 
[1..n] a list from 1 to whatever n is 
    eager oop languages would hate this notation 
    and choke on trying to call a potentially 
    infinite list
