Catching Up with Us:

We are currently on Chapter 9 in Hutton's book but for catchup purposes is in Book section is in More/File sec of the Meet-Up site.

However,
"Learn You a Haskell for a Greater Good" might be a quicker study. 
We have also incorporated chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9 from: http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters

Most important for playing along at home, and elsewhere is:
Downloading and installing the G.H.C. (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) which is part of: http://www.haskell.org/platform/

For OSX-Maverick heres some special instructions, http://haskell-workshop.github.io/tutorials/osx/2013-10-23-mavericks-ghc.html

here is the link to the Eriks video series: https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals/Lecture-Series-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-1 
next time we meet we will view Chapter 9 video. 

NOTE! the Haskell-platform, has all the tools we'll need and then some. The book and video both use the deprecated Hugs compiler; it works okay; but the renowned Glasgow Haskell Compiler 7.6.x included in the Haskell-platform, is the current standard.

When it's installed and you open a command prompt (terminal) and type ghci you should get the prelude prompt, 
Prelude> 
And you are ready to go.


Any text editor will do, but some do a better job of highlighting and such. 
Popular choices are Emacs, and Vim.  
Sublime also work Notepad++. 
Not matter the editor 
It's a good idea to set tabs to spaces otherwise GHC will complain.
