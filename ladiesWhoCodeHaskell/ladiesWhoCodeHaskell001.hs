C the language of Unix and everything that follows
   C is to Engineering 
   as
   Java & C# are to biz
   as 
   Haskell is to Math 
    it was for experimentation 
    Math and Logic are it's roots 
      I/O was 7 years in the making 
      Others steal from Haskell 
      the way they used to steal from SmallTalk 
        cloud-computing 
        STM 
        parallelization 

It is Industrial Strength
    Facebook and Google have uses for it 
    Some big banks use it. 

It's as fast as Java out of the box
  as fast as C in certain situations
  on average 24 times faster than Ruby
  
Libraries

Some history 
earth cools 
humans displace Neanderthals 
Greeks invent Geometry 
 earning the ire of high school students for ever after

1987 committee forms to design a language based on everything that was known about programming since C,  Algol68 and SmallTalk.

1997 Haskell 98

2005 GHC overtakes all the other compilers 
  optimizations for speed and reliability become paramount
  package management via Cabal begins

2009 Haskell 2010
  which is 98 + extras
  programs written for 98 run on 2010 with little or no modification
  (n+k) goes away and there are many tears. 

2013 Evie discovers Haskell and starts Haskell for Cats 
      "because programing is hard and cats are busy"
     
2014 Haskell is poised to become the SmallTalk of 21st Cent.
