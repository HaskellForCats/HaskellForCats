from SmallTalk-80 by Goldberg and Robson circa 1983 

A CLASS describes the implementation of a set of 
OBJECTS that all represent the same kind of system component. 

The individual objects described by a CLASS are called its 
instances.

An object's public properties are the messages that make up its 
interface.

An object's private properties are a set of 
INSTANCE VARIABLES that make up its 
PRIVATE memory and a set of METHODS that describe how to carry out its operations.

A MESSAGE is a request for an object to carry out one of its operations.

A MESSAGE specifies which operation is desired, but not how that operation should be carried out. The RECEIVER, the object to which the message was sent, determines how to carry out the requested operation.

The set of messages to which an object can respond is called its INTERFACE with the rest of the system. The only way to interact with an object is through its INTERFACE.

A crucial property of an OBJECT is that its 
PRIVATE memory can be manipulated only by its own operations. 

A crucial property of MESSAGEs is that they are the only way to invoke an object's operations.  

An object cannot depend on the internal details of other objects, 
only on the messages to which they respond.


MESSAGES insure the modularity of the system because they specify the type of operation desired, but not how that operation should be accomplished.
