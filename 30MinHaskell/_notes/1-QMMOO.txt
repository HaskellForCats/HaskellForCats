        determinacy
       linear 



State that isn't knowable in its entirety

Einstein hated quantum mechanics because he couldn't visualize it and therefore had trouble reasoning about it

The Quantum state ordering multiplication matters at the level of classical mechanics order does not matter

We have a tension between wave spread particle density.

On average atoms are mostly empty space 

Matter is the leftovers from quantum foam action 

Why does mayonnaise hold its viscosity

At the level of quantum foam all States are possible for once particles coalesce around an orbit this reduces the probability that they will be elsewhere and therefore less room for variation and randomness. 

Engineers are told to shut up and calculate As programmers are told to shut up an program

We are made up of the stuff of rocks putting us it produces something that can think about the nature of rocks

Mapping of programming objects to real world objects is a loose analogy at best;
