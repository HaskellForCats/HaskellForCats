Propositions are types;
	&
Proofs are programs.

-- AGLEBRA RULES -- 

x + 0 = x 
x * 1 = x
x + y = y + x 
x * y = y * x 
(x + y) + z = x + (y + z) 
(x * y) * z = x * (y * z) 
x * (y + z) = x * y + x * z 

using just these rules 
we can rewrite: 
  things that look algebraic,
  addition 
  Propositional logic
  Set Theory 
  Program evaluation
