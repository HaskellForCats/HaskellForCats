Moore's observation ... "processing power was doubling approximately every 24 months". 

But this gave way to: 

The Multicore Era:
	2005 -- manufacturers fit all of a CPU's functionality into half the area. 
	2006 -- dual-core CPUs ...  
	   where each chip gives the functionality of two traditional CPUs. 

	2008 -- quad-core 

Today 
	Intel's Xeon Phi coprocessor currently offers up to 61 cores, with a 72-core standalone model expected this year.

Traditional, sequential programs are written for one core; 
	Multicore CPU's require a parallel approach.

	Developers who are still writing sequential software are writing for yesterday's hardware ... (Joel C. Adams @ http://cacm.acm.org/)
