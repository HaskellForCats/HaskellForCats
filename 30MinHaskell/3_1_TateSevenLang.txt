Final Thoughts
Of the functional languages in the book, 
Haskell was the most difficult to learn. 
The emphasis on monads and the type system made the learning curve steep. 
Once I mastered some of the key concepts, things got easier, 
and it became the most rewarding language I learned. 
Based on the type system and the elegance of the application of monads, 
one day we'll look back at this language as one of the most important in this book.
Haskell plays another role, too. 
The purity of the approach and the academic focus will both improve our understanding of programming. 
The best of the next generation of functional programmers in many places will cut their teeth on Haskell.
