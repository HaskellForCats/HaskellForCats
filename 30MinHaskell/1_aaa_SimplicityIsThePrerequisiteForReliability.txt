Simplicity equals opportunity
	P. Graham

Simplicity is the prerequisite for reliability
	E. dykstra

But the Saddest part is, 
	Forces in the industry are against simplicity. 
	You will not get pats on the back for simplicity. 
	At times you will be derided for being simple.

	Simple code, 
	because it's simple and movable,
		gets replaced, 
		by complex code, 
		which roots in like a tumor;

	It's excracation could kill the patient.
	Code obscurity often equals job security.

Simplicity is a choice.

Thus I recommend: The transvaluation of objects to functions.
