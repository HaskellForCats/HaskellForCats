Object Orientation conflates:
	identity
	value
	and state;
		once munged; it's difficult 
		to extracate anyone of them

Complexity abounds:
	Data structures, 
		wrapped in classes are complex.
	Syntax is complex.
	Positional arguments to statements 
		are complex
	Looping is complex
		nested looping is even more complex;
	ORM is OMG complex.
	Messaging objects for their contents is complex.
	Call chaining is Chaining complexities together.
	Order and sequence are stateful by themselves
	Monitoring a myriad of objects 
		for continual change super complex.

It's all managable on one core with serial processes.
