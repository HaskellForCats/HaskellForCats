What is Haskell? 

Haskell is a General purpose programming language.

Haskell is purely functional.

Haskell is strictly statically typed. 

Haskell is lazy by default. 

Haskell has Type inference.

This Trinity of the weird features, make it about as far away from the C paradigm as you can currently get and still expect get significant work done. 

Experience with Lisp or Clojure reduce the the exoticism, as would experience with scheme or F sharp or ocaml. But even those don't quite go as far away from familiar Territory as Haskell. 

Most commercial languages are bound to their C heritage. They can head in the direction of Haskell but never quite get there because of the compromises that must be made in order to satisfy their C Origins.
