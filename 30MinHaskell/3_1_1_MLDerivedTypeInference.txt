ML derived type inference makes Haskell "feel" dynamically typed
    But:
    The strong-static typing,
    allows for ultra optimization by the compiler.
    A concision that is 
    on par with Ruby, 
    but an execution that is as fast as Java, 
    (see benchmarks).

Haskell offers, a provable level of correctness.
  And Parallelization is made easier.    

  Monads provide: 
    type-safe Action-Blocks 
    that handle all real world interaction.
