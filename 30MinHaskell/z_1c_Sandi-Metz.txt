"object-oriented software fails when the act of design is separated from the 
act of programming. 

Agile processes guarantee change and your ability to make these changes depends 
on your application's design. If you cannot write well-designed code you'll have to rewrite your application during every iteration.

Poor Object Oriented Design metrics are indisputably a sign of bad design; 
Unfortunately, good scores don't prove the opposite;"

Like tests they can discern a problem, but not affirm efficacy.
