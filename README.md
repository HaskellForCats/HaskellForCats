Haskell_For_Cats
================

Stuff for a Haskell Study Group in NYC

Haskell_For_Cats:
Because Haskell can be hard, and cats are busy, but if they can do it so can you.   

Join the Meetup:
http://www.meetup.com/Haskell_For_Cats/

Please download and install the G.H.C. (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) which is part of: 
http://www.haskell.org/platform/ 

For OSX-Maverick here's some special instructions, thanks to Kat: 
http://haskell-workshop.github.io/tutorials/osx/2013-10-23-mavericks-ghc.html  


here  is the link to the Erik's video:

NOTE! the Haskell-platform, has all the tools we'll need and then some. 
The book and video both use the deprecated Hugs compiler; it works okay; 
but the renowned Glasgow Haskell Compiler  7.8.x included in the Haskell-platform, 
is the current standard. 

When it's installed and you open a command prompt (terminal) and type ghci 
you should get the prelude prompt, Prelude>. 
And you are ready to go. 

Those using windows might have an easier time with WinGHCi, 
which makes loading modules easier. 

Any text editor will do, but some do a better job of highlighting and such. 
Popular choices are Emacs, Vim, and Sublime. 
It's a good idea to set tabs to spaces otherwise GHC will complain.

Some general tips on programming in Haskell.
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_programming_tips

---------------------------------------------	

	Why Haskell? 

        Because Haskell is fast: (out of the box), 
		as fast as Java and way more terse.
		and (with tweaking) 
		Haskell can be as fast as C++, 
		with less errors.
	
	
	Because memory 
                is NOW cheap enough 
                        and so are CPUs and GPUs.
	
	
	Because Haskell will scale: 
		presently to 40+ cores* and 
		reach 20+ million new requests per second 
		on a single machine.
	
	Because Haskell is terse and concise: 
		The stats are: 1.4 bugs per 100 lines of code, 
		regardless of the language.
		Less lines of code = less bugs.
		
	Because Haskell favors lazy evaluation:
		It can work with infinite values, and not blow the stack, 
		Haskell just calls only what it needs only when it needs it.

	Because it is strongly typed:
		Strong typing reduces mismatch errors. 
		'cause if some idiot can, 
                some idiot will; 
		and late at night 
                after the nth beer 
			that idiot might just be you.
	
	Because Haskell is self documenting
		wanna know what a function does just ask it.
		It will tell you what it takes in 
		and what it gives back, 
		always!
	
        Because Haskell weeds out sloppy programming habits. 
                If it is sloppily done it wont compile.

	Because Haskell is faster to working code. 
		'cause once Haskell has compiled you are more than half done.

	Because there is less to test. 
		Pure functions, reduce your testing surface. 
		Same inputs yield same results regardless of context. 
		Immutability, means less shared memory. 
		Haskell is NOT fragile!  

	Because Haskell is almost entirely stateless, 
		Pure functions, are immutable, and unchanging.  
		Mutability is safely contained in monads 
                stuff doesn't change without your consent.
                 
	Haskell has a direct connection to Lambda Calculus; it strives for mathmatical purity. 
		In Haskell: mathmatics and computer science converge rather than bang heads.
		You don't have to think math + computor, you can think just the math instead. 

---------------------------
		
	Where would you use it?
	
	Anywhere you need: 
		many-core concurrency 
      		big sort
		big compute, 
		fast matching,
      		quick transformations
		and tighter security.
	
	And you can use it in addition to other languages; 
	it is strength where and 
	when you need it, 
	and it's pretty to. =)

-- settings and such --
Erik Meijer makes much use of (n + k) which has been dropped from the Haskell 2010 spec. So as not to get an error when compiling you want to do either of these two steps. 
start the compiler with this command
ghci -XNPlusKPatterns

or

use this at the top the module 
{-# LANGUAGE NPlusKPatterns #-}
-----------------------------------
to kill the monomorphic resriction 
 ghci prompt >  :set -XNoMonomorphismRestriction  
 - or use this in the header of your file/module  {-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}
